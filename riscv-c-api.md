## Preprocessor Definitions

| Name                | Value | When defined                  |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| __riscv             | 1     | Always defined.               |

### __riscv_v_min_vlen

The `__riscv_v_min_vlen` macro expands to the minimal VLEN, in bits, mandated
by the available vector extension, if any.

The value of `__riscv_v_min_vlen` is defined by the following rules:
- 128, if the `V` extension is present;
- 32, if one of the `Zve32{x,f}` extensions is present;
- 64, if one of the `Zve64{x,f,d}` extensions is present;
- `N`, if one of the `Zvl<N>b` extensions, `N` in `{32,64,128,256,512,1024}`,
is present.

If multiple rules apply, the maximum value is taken.
If none of the rules apply, `__riscv_v_min_vlen` is undefined.

Examples:

- `__riscv_v_min_vlen` is 128 for `rv64gcv`
- `__riscv_v_min_vlen` is 512 for `rv32gcv_zvl512b`
- `__riscv_v_min_vlen` is 256 for `rv32gcv_zvl32b_zvl256b`
- `__riscv_v_min_vlen` is 128 for `rv64gcv_zvl32b`

### __riscv_v_elen

The `__riscv_v_elen` macro expands to the supported element length, in bits,
of any non-floating-point vector operand of any vector instruction in the
available vector extension, if any. (Stricter upper bounds may apply to
particular operands of particular instructions.)


The value of `__riscv_v_elen` is defined by the following rules:
- 64, if the `V` extension or one of the `Zve64{x,f,d}` extensions is present; and
- 32, if one of the `Zve32{x,f}` extensions is present.
If multiple rules apply, the maximum value is taken.
If none of the rules apply, `__riscv_v_elen` is undefined.

### __riscv_v_elen_fp

The `__riscv_v_elen_fp` macro expands to the supported element length, in bits,
of any floating-point vector operand of any vector instruction in the available
vector extension, if any. (Stricter upper bounds may apply to particular
operands of particular instructions.)

The value of `__riscv_v_elen_fp` is defined by the following rules:
- 64, if one of the `V` or `Zve64d` extensions is present;
- 32, if one of the `Zve{32,64}f` extensions is present; and
- 0, if one of the `Zve{32,64}x` extensions is present.
If multiple rules apply, the maximum value is taken.
If none of the rules apply, `__riscv_v_elen_fp` is undefined.


### Architecture Extension Test Macro

Architecture extension test macro is a new set of test macro to checking the
availability and version for certain extension, however not all compilers are
supported, so you should check `__riscv_arch_test` to make sure this compiler
is supporting those preprocessor definitions.

The value of architecture extension test macro are defined as its version,
which is compute by following formula:

```
<MAJOR_VERSION> * 1,000,000 + <MINOR_VERSION> * 1,000 + <REVISION_VERSION>
```

For example:
- F-extension v2.2 will define `__riscv_f` as `2002000`.

| Name                    | Value        | When defined                  |

*[1] Not all compilers provide `-mno-div` and `-mno-fdiv` option.

## Function Attributes

### `__attribute__((naked))`

The compiler won't generate the prologue/epilogue for those functions with
`naked` attributes. This attribute is usually used when you want to write a
function with an inline assembly body.

This attribute is incompatible with the `interrupt` attribute.

NOTE: Be aware that compilers might have further restrictions on naked
functions. Please consult your compiler's manual for more information.

### `__attribute__((interrupt))`, `__attribute__((interrupt("user")))`, `__attribute__((interrupt("supervisor")))` `__attribute__((interrupt("machine")))`

The interrupt attribute specifies that a function is an interrupt handler.
The compiler will save/restore all used registers in the prologue/epilogue
regardless of the ABI, all used registers including floating point
register/vector register if `F` extension/vector extension is enabled.

The interrupt attribute can have an optional parameter to specify the mode.
The possible values are `user`, `supervisor`, or `machine`.
The default value `machine` is used, if the mode is not specified.

The function can specify only one mode; the compiler should raise an error if a
function declares more than one mode or an undefined mode.

This attribute is incompatible with the `naked` attribute.

## Intrinsic Functions

Intrinsic functions (or intrinsics or built-ins) are expanded into instruction sequences by compilers.
They typically provide access to functionality that is otherwise not synthesizable by compilers.
Some intrinsics expand to different code sequences depending on the available instructions from the enabled ISA extensions.

Compilers typically come with their own architecture-independent intrinsics (e.g. synchronization primitives, byte-swap, etc.).
The RISC-V compiler backend can define additional target-specific intrinsics.
Providing functionality via architecture-independent intrinsics is the preferred method, as it improves code portability.

Some intrinsics are only available if a particular header file is included.
RISC-V header files that enable intrinsics require the prefix `riscv_` (e.g. `riscv_vector.h` or `riscv_crypto.h`).

RISC-V specific intrinsics use the common prefix `__riscv_` to avoid namespace collisions.

The intrinsic name describes the functional behaviour of the function.
In case the functionality can be expressed with a single instruction, the instruction's name (any '.' replaced by '_') is the preferred choice.
Note, that intrinsics that are restricted to RISC-V vendor extensions need to include the vendor prefix (as documented in the RISC-V toolchain conventions).

If intrinsics are available for multiple data types, then function overloading is preferred over multiple type-specific functions.
If an intrinsic function is has parameters or return values that reference registers with XLEN bits, then the data type `long` should be used.
In case a function is only available for one data type and this type cannot be derived from the function's name, then the type should be appended to the function name, delimited by a '_' character.
Typical type postfixes are "32" (32-bit), "i32" (signed 32-bit), "i8m4" (vector register group consisting of 4 signed 8-bit vector registers).

RISC-V intrinsics follow the following naming rule:

```
INTRINSIC ::= PREFIX NAME [ '_' TYPE ]
PREFIX ::= "__riscv_"
NAME ::= Name of the intrinsic function.
TYPE ::= Optional type postfix.
```

RISC-V intrinsics examples:

```
type __riscv_orc_b (type rs); // orc.b rd, rs

long __riscv_clmul (long a, long b); // clmul rd, rs1, rs2

#include <riscv_vector.h> // make RISC-V vector intrinsics available
vint8m1_t __riscv_vadd_vv_i8m1(vint8m1_t vs2, vint8m1_t vs1, size_t vl); // vadd.vv vd, vs2, vs1
```

### riscv_intrinsic.h

This file is universal intrinsic header file for all extensions, each extension
could have their own header files, but should included in this file if
corresponding extension is enabled.

This header file also defined several common RISC-V specific type and related
marco could be used in intrinsic interface or user program directly.

| Type Name             | Meaning                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| int_xlen_t            | Signed integer type with XLEN bits   |
| uint_xlen_t           | Unsigned integer type with XLEN bits |

| Macro Name            | Value                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| INT_XLEN_MAX          | Minimum value of int_xlen_t          |
| INT_XLEN_MIN          | Minimum value of int_xlen_t          |
| UINT_XLEN_MAX         | Maximum value of uint_xlen_t         |
| UINT_XLEN_MIN         | Minimum value of uint_xlen_t         |

## Constraints on Operands of Inline Assembly Statements

This section lists operand constraints that can be used with inline assembly
statements, including both RISC-V specific and common operand constraints.


| Constraint         |                                    | Note        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| m                  | An address that is held in a general-purpose register with offset.      |      |
| A                  | An address that is held in a general-purpose register.      |      |
| r                  | General purpose register                      |      |
| f                  | Floating-point register                       |      |
| i                  | Immediate integer operand                     |      |
| I                  | 12-bit signed immediate integer operand      |      |
| K                  | 5-bit unsigned immediate integer operand     |      |
| J                  | Zero integer immediate operand                |      |
| vr                 | Vector register                    |            |
| vd                 | Vector register, excluding v0      |            |
| vm                 | Vector register, only v0           |            |

NOTE: Immediate value must be a compile-time constant.

### The Difference Between `m` and `A` Constraints

The difference between `m` and `A` is whether the operand can have an offset;
some instructions in RISC-V do not allow an offset for the address operand,
such as atomic or vector load/store instructions.

The following example demonstrates the difference; it is trying
to load value from `foo[10]` and using `m` and `A` to pass that address.

```c
int *foo;
void bar() {
 int x;
 __asm__ volatile ("lw %0, %1" : "=r"(x) : "m" (foo[10]));
 __asm__ volatile ("lw %0, %1" : "=r"(x) : "A" (foo[10]));
}
```

Then we compile with GCC with `-O` option:

```shell
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc x.c -o - -O -S
...
bar:
       lui    a5,%hi(foo)
       ld     a5,%lo(foo)(a5)
 #APP
# 4 "x.c" 1
       lw a4, 40(a5)
# 0 "" 2
 #NO_APP
       addi   a5,a5,40
 #APP
# 5 "x.c" 1
       lw a5, 0(a5)
# 0 "" 2
 #NO_APP
       ret

```

The compiler uses an immediate offset of 40 for the `m` constraint, but for the
`A` constraint uses an extra addi instruction instead.
